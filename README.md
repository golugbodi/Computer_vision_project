Rock-paper-scissors is an age-old hand game, normally played between two people, in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand gestures with an outstretched hand, representing rock, paper, or scissors, with an outstretched hand. Rock is represented by a closed fist, paper by a flat hand, and scissors by a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V. Scissors beats paper, rock beats scissors, and paper beats rock. 

This is an implementation of the rock-paper-scissors game, achieved by creating a deep learning model, using Googleâ€™s Teachable Machine.
